# CLA Policy

This project uses:

- DCO sign-off on every commit (`DCO`)
- Individual CLA (ICLA) for each contributor (`CLA/ICLA.md`)
- Corporate CLA (CCLA) for employer-owned contributions (`CLA/CCLA.md`)

This documentation is an operational template, not legal advice.

## Why This Model

- Inbound = outbound: contributions stay under the project's existing license map (`LICENSES.md`).
- No copyright assignment.
- No extra patent or relicensing grant in the CLA.

## Identity Rules

- Anonymous and pseudonymous contributions are not accepted.
- A government-issued legal name is not required.
- Signers must use a consistent human name and a reachable email address.

## Individual Contribution Flow

1. Open a PR.
2. Sign commits with DCO (`git commit -s`).
3. Accept the ICLA in the PR when prompted by the CLA check.

## Corporate Contribution Flow

1. If your employer may own your work product, use the CCLA path.
2. An authorized company representative signs `CLA/CCLA.md`.
3. Maintainers add the company and approved contributor accounts to `CLA/COMPANIES.md`.
4. Contributors still sign commits with DCO (`git commit -s`).

## Submit CCLA

Open an issue titled `[CCLA] Organization onboarding` and maintainers will provide
a private channel for exchanging signed CCLA paperwork.
