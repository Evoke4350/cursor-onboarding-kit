# Cursor Context Focus: 30 Practical Ways

This is the fastest way to improve output quality: control context on purpose.

## 30 context-focusing moves

1. Start with a single file reference.
2. Add one folder only when needed.
3. Include a failing test before asking for a fix.
4. Include exact error output, not paraphrase.
5. Add `git diff` context for review tasks.
6. Add `git status` context for staging/commit tasks.
7. Use `@` mentions for explicit context targeting.
8. Use `@files` for exact source files.
9. Use `@folders` for bounded subtree scope.
10. Use `@git` when asking history/regression questions.
11. Use `@past chats` when continuity matters.
12. Use `@web` only for recency gaps.
13. Keep web context separate from code context.
14. Ask for a short restatement before edits.
15. Require an in-scope/out-of-scope recap.
16. Demand assumptions list before implementation.
17. Pin one output schema for the whole task.
18. Split research and implementation into separate runs.
19. Use subagents for broad exploration only.
20. Re-run with reduced context when drift appears.
21. Attach screenshots for UI bug context.
22. Use browser-run evidence for DOM/network issues.
23. Pull terminal history into prompt for command debugging.
24. Include current branch name and target branch.
25. Include constraints from `AGENTS.md` explicitly.
26. Include local overrides only when relevant.
27. Provide acceptance checks before code generation.
28. Ask for rollback plan when risk is medium or high.
29. Keep one objective per prompt.
30. End with a pass/fail checklist tied to evidence.

## Rule of thumb

Too much context creates confident noise.  
Too little context creates shallow output.  
The right context creates reliable execution.
