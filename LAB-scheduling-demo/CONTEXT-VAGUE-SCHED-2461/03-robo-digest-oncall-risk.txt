ROBO DIGEST AUTO-SUMMARY
Generated: 2026-02-10T02:11:03Z
Confidence: 0.62

Summary:
- Stakeholders want "fewer scary numbers" in weekly report output.
- Engineering keeps asking if this is cosmetic or logic correction. No final answer.
- Incident responders report escalations can stop without fallback target.
- APAC timezone complaints likely involve half-hour offset parsing.
- PM asked for minimal blast radius and no schema changes.

Suggested action clusters:
1) Reporting labels and dual-metric explanation
2) Escalation fallback reliability
3) Timezone parse resilience

Risk flags:
- Conflicting stakeholder goals: "hide confusion" vs "preserve raw truth."
- If only labels change, incident review trust may worsen.
- If only logic changes, CSV consumers may break.
