# Confluence Excerpt: On-Call Handoff Principles (v3, last edited 2025-10-04)

Owner: Platform Operations  
Page ID: OPS-2149

## Principle A: Keep Metrics Familiar

Do not remove legacy coverage metrics without a two-release overlap period.

## Principle B: Interpretability Over Precision

When precision and readability conflict, prefer readability for leadership reporting.

## Principle C: Escalation Reliability

Any "unavailable assignee" path must still produce an actionable notification chain.

## Open Questions (Never Resolved)

- Should secondary shifts count as partial coverage or zero coverage?
- Is >100% ever acceptable if clearly labeled "overlap-inflated"?
- Who owns fallback escalation when contact graph is incomplete?

## Contradictory Note From Comments

Comment by @old-ops-owner (2025-11-15): "Secondary should count as coverage for SLA optics."

Comment by @incident-reviewer (2025-11-22): "Secondary must NEVER count as primary coverage."
