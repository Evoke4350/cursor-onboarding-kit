Channel topic: "Why is coverage green and pager still on fire"

[09:12] @maria.ops: Coverage card says 132% and we still missed a page. How are both true?
[09:14] @jon.lead: Secondary coverage is being treated as full in reports. It looks good, feels bad.
[09:16] @eli.pm: Can we avoid numbers over 100 in dashboards? Leadership gets stuck on it.
[09:18] @sre-dan: Please do NOT hide raw values. We need audit truth in incident review.
[09:19] @maria.ops: Also escalation silently dies when contact is missing. No UI clue.
[09:21] @eli.pm: Maybe just simplify labels this sprint and do logic later?
[09:23] @sre-dan: If logic stays wrong, labels are lipstick on a pager outage.
[09:27] @sam.support: APAC says UTC+5:30 users still have "ghost conflicts."
[09:29] @eli.pm: Need a plan that does not break exports and does not take a quarter.
