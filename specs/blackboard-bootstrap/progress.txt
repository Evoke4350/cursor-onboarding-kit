# Progress: Bootstrap Agentic Blackboard

## 2026-02-17 Session 1

### Completed
- Cloned arscontexta to ~/arscontexta
- Cloned agent-os to ~/agent-os
- Explored arscontexta: 249 research claims, 6-phase setup, domain generation, hooks
- Explored agent-os: shape-spec command, standards system, spec-driven development
- Created epic bead: cursor-onboarding-kit-a4z
- Created task beads for design work
- User chose: Workshop naming, Engineering-first framework, File-based hooks

### In Progress
- Designing workshop naming scheme
- Designing engineering-first framework (5 Cs)

### Completed (Session 1 continued)
- Researched Cursor extensibility → MCP-based, no hook API
- Researched Dicklesworthstone repos (dcg, xf, coding_agent_session_search)
- Scraped Universalis doc → taint analysis for AI agents
- User chose: Workshop naming, Engineering-first framework, File-based hooks
- User chose: Spec only, Tool architecture focus
- Created TOOL-ARCHITECTURE.md spec

### Next
- Design the 5 Cs framework in detail (Capture, Cut, Carve, Chamfer, Check)
- Design gum-based setup script
- Create tool definition templates
- Spec out search architecture (xf-style hybrid)

### Key Decisions
- bench/ = graph space (MOCs, identity, methodology)
- shavings/ = notes (atomic insights)
- sawdust/ = ops (session logs, queues)
- Framework: 5 Cs (Capture, Cut, Carve, Chamfer, Check) + Sharpen
- Hooks: File-based watching, no Cursor IDE API available

### Learnings from arscontexta
- Derivation > templating — conversation drives configuration
- Domain adaptation is non-negotiable — users need their language
- Three-space separation prevents predictable failures
- Justification chains enable evolution
- Fresh context per phase preserves quality
- 249 research claims back every decision

## 2026-02-18 Session 2

### Completed
- Cloned agno and agent-os-prod repos
- Explored Agno framework → memory schema, knowledge base, guardrails, events
- Discovered Cursor SQLite hooks (UNDOCUMENTED GOLD!)
  - state.vscdb in globalStorage and workspaceStorage
  - cursorDiskKV table with composerData and bubbleId entries
  - Full conversation history extraction possible
- Created 7 domain epics for decomposition
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md with full domain breakdown and user stories

### Domain Structure Created
1. Security & Taint [i5h] - Taint analysis, .cursorignore, .secrets protection
2. Cursor Integration [0hq] - SQLite hooks, .cursor/hooks.json, session extraction
3. Knowledge & Memory [kph] - Agno patterns, UserMemory schema, RAG
4. Processing Pipeline [5gk] - 5 Cs framework, fresh context per phase
5. Setup & Onboarding [i2s] - Gum-based interactive setup, 6-phase process
6. Tool Architecture [j4b] - File-based tools, Cursor discovery pattern
7. CLI & Runtime [7vp] - Rust CLI, SIMD, performance budgets

### Key Learnings
- Cursor hooks DO exist in .cursor/hooks.json but have reliability bugs
- .cursorignore is recommended for hard denial
- Agno provides production-ready memory/knowledge patterns
- Dicklesworth's cursor.rs shows how to read Cursor's SQLite directly
- Universalis taint analysis can be adapted for AI workflows

### Completed (Session 2 continued)
- Created 8th domain: Proof of Work [clz] - Showboat integration
- Created CROSS-REFERENCE-MATRIX.md - All 29 tasks mapped to source code
- Created INTEGRATION-PLAN.md - Module-by-module port details with code snippets
- Updated RISK-ASSESSMENT-UPDATED.md - 85% confidence (up from 70%)
- Created RALPH-METAPROMPT.md - Operating instructions for Ralph loop

### Spot Check Findings (from beads-only analysis)
**GAPS IDENTIFIED:**
1. Source code refs not in beads - beads have descriptions but not source paths
2. Acceptance criteria not in beads - 113 ACs in ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.md not linked
3. O-04 multiple sources - needs all ~/arscontexta/generators/features/*.md
4. No compose.rs task - integration composition not tracked
5. R-03 complexity - xf hybrid.rs (1-859 lines) may need subtasks

**BEAD AUDIT:**
- 8 DOMAIN epics ✓
- 21 P0 implementation tasks ✓
- 8 P1 tasks ✓
- 7 DOC tasks (unrelated to blackboard)
- 16 research/design tasks (context only)

### Next
- Fix bead gaps (add source refs to descriptions)
- Execute Ralph loop: `while :; do cat specs/blackboard-bootstrap/PROMPT.md | claude-code ; done`
