# CLAUDE.md (Template)

Claude Code compatibility shim.
Canonical team policy lives in `AGENTS.md`.

## Compatibility Bridge

Import the canonical file so instructions stay in one place:

`@AGENTS.md`

## Claude-Specific Notes

- Put only Claude-specific memory here (if needed).
- Keep shared policy in `AGENTS.md` to avoid drift.
- Keep `CLAUDE.local.md` for personal, local-only preferences.
