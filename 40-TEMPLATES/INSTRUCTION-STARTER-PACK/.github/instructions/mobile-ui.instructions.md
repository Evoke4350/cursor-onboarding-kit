# Mobile UI Instructions (Template)

- Keep UI edits focused and minimal.
- Prefer explicit render conditions over truthy/falsy coercion for numeric/string values.
- Do not change unrelated component structure in bugfix tasks.
- If behavior is ambiguous, ask a clarifying question before broad edits.
