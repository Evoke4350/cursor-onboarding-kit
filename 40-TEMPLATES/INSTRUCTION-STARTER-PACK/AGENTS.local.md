# AGENTS.local.md (Template, local-only)

## Personal Operating Preferences

- Keep responses concise and direct.
- Start with discussion-first for ambiguous asks.
- Default prompt style: "read context, make medium-sized change, show evidence."
- Require explicit in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries.

## Personal Guardrails

- No broad cleanup unless requested.
- No speculative architecture changes in bugfix sessions.
- Prefer deterministic output schemas in reviews and run notes.

## Local-Only Notes

This file is intended for local use and should be excluded from git in `.git/info/exclude`.
