# Agentic Blackboard - AI Engineering and Workflow Jumpstart Kit

This repo is intentionally deep. Treat it like a library, not required reading.

If you're drowning: forget the repo. Pick one file that's breaking your flow and fix that first.

## Lifeline (One File, 10 Minutes)

Pick one file that hurts (the one you touch 10 times a day), then paste this:

```text
No repo tour. No docs.
Read only this file.

1) What is it supposed to do?
2) What is it doing instead?
3) What's the smallest safe fix?

Then stop and ask me one question if you need to.
```

Ship the smallest evidence-backed fix. Come back for depth only if you want it.

## Core Loop (5 Prompts)

Run one real ticket with this chain:

1. Discussion: `No edits yet. Restate problem, risks, and fix order.`
2. Scope: `Define in-scope, out-of-scope, and done criteria.`
3. Execute: `Fix one bug cluster with minimal blast radius.`
4. Verify: `Show scenario table with expected vs actual.`
5. Package: `Propose commit groups and a PR summary.`

If you only open three docs:

- [`00-START-HERE.md`](./00-START-HERE.md)
- [`05-AGENT-OPERATOR-PATTERN.md`](./05-AGENT-OPERATOR-PATTERN.md)
- [`20-PROMPT-PATTERNS.md`](./20-PROMPT-PATTERNS.md)

## What This Repo Is

- A depth layer behind a short live demo.
- A reusable set of prompts and templates for teams that want to go further.
- Two training labs with intentionally planted bugs for teaching workflow discipline.
