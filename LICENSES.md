# Repository Licensing Map

This repository intentionally uses multiple licenses. That is normal when code,
templates, and educational content have different reuse goals.

## Default License

- `LICENSE` (MIT) is the repository default.
- If a file or folder does not declare a different license, treat it as MIT.

## Explicit Overrides

- `40-TEMPLATES/` template assets: Unlicense
  - See `40-TEMPLATES/UNLICENSE` and `40-TEMPLATES/LICENSE-SCOPE.md`.
- `LAB-scheduling-demo/` code and runtime assets: MIT
  - See `LAB-scheduling-demo/LICENSE`.
- `LAB-scheduling-demo/` instructional docs and narrative material: CC BY 4.0
  - See `LAB-scheduling-demo/LICENSE-CONTENT.md`.

## Scope Resolution Order

When licenses appear to conflict, resolve scope in this order:

1. File-level notice/header
2. Nearest folder-level license file
3. Repository default (`LICENSE`, MIT)

## Practical Usage Rules

- Reusing code: keep MIT notice.
- Reusing templates from `40-TEMPLATES/`: Unlicense terms apply.
- Reusing instructional/narrative docs from `LAB-scheduling-demo/`: provide CC BY attribution.

## Attribution and Adaptation

For scheduling-lab documentation, attribution and remix/adaptation rights are
defined by CC BY 4.0 in `LAB-scheduling-demo/LICENSE-CONTENT.md`.
