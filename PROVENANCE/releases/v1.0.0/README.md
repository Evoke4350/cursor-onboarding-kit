# Release Provenance Dossier: v1.0.0

This folder contains release-pinned provenance records for published artifacts.

## Scope

- Official release tag: `v1.0.0`
- Branch prerelease tags:
  - `branch-main-v1.0.0`
  - `branch-zero-context-playground-2026-02-17-v1.0.0`
  - `branch-cursor-ai-2026-02-17-v1.0.0`

## Owner Field Guidance

Use `Owner` as artifact stewardship, not legal copyright ownership.

Recommended value for this repo:

- `Project maintainers (represented by Nathaniel Bennett)`

CLA/DCO note:

- CLA and DCO define contribution rights and attestations.
- They do not require the provenance `Owner` field to list every contributor.

## Completed Records

- `official-v1.0.0.md`
- `branch-main-v1.0.0.md`
- `branch-zero-context-playground-2026-02-17-v1.0.0.md`
- `branch-cursor-ai-2026-02-17-v1.0.0.md`

## Still Optional For Human Fill-In

- Internal reviewer name(s) or approver group (if you want named accountability)
- Optional link to internal review notes/ticket
- Confidence override (keep `high` unless new facts emerge)
- Any additional mitigations specific to your internal governance model
