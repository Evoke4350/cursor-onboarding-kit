# Cursor Shortcuts (Advanced Follow-Up)

You do not need 50 shortcuts. You need 8 that reduce friction every day.

## Core set

- `Cmd/Ctrl + L`: open chat quickly.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` in terminal: generate shell command with context.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` in terminal prompt: run generated command immediately.
- Type `/`: invoke saved workflow commands.
- Type `@`: attach explicit context targets.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`: command palette for mode/tool toggles.
- Use selection + chat action: send exact code span instead of describing it.
- Use browser tool capture when debugging UI state, not memory.

## Senior habits

- default to keyboard for context attachment
- do not mix review and implementation in one thread
- prefer command files over repeated long prompts
- bind one shortcut ritual per workflow (debug, review, ship)

## What to avoid

- shortcut collecting without measurable workflow gain
- firing broad prompts before attaching concrete evidence
- overusing auto-run in sensitive repos
