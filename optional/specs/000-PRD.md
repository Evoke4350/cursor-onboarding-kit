# PRD: Cursor Docs Scrape → Markdown Tips
**Format:** Geoff Huntley / Ralph Loop Decomposition
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Epic bead:** cursor-onboarding-kit-71q

---

## Problem

We have 42 tip files extracted from the Cursor *changelog* (Aug 2025–Feb 2026) following a strict editorial protocol. The changelog is retrospective — it tells you what *changed*. The Cursor *documentation* at docs.cursor.com is prescriptive — it tells you how things *actually work*. These are complementary sources and the docs are the authoritative reference for:

- Exact feature behavior (not marketing language)
- Configuration options and defaults
- API reference for Background Agents, CLI, MCP
- Workflows the changelog never mentioned

The talk needs both layers: what arrived (changelog tips) and how it works (docs tips).

---

## Goal

Scrape all 448 English pages from docs.cursor.com into dated markdown tip files. Apply the **identical strict protocol** used for the changelog tips:

- Source URL (verbatim)
- Date scraped: 2026-02-17
- Verification status: VERBATIM or PARAPHRASE or NOT-FOUND
- Exact quote from the page (verbatim, ≤3 sentences per quote block, split if longer)
- Do not combine quotes from different sections
- Include reasoning, hedges, qualifiers
- Demo talking point
- Audience note

Output directory: `LAB-changelog-viewer/output/docs/`
Naming: `{section}/{slug}.md` mirroring the docs URL path structure

---

## Scope

**448 English docs pages** across 28 sections (see specs/001-sections.md).

Expected output: ~448 markdown files. Some pages will yield multiple tip files if they contain multiple distinct learnable concepts. Some (e.g. pure reference pages like API parameter lists) may yield a single "reference" tip with a summary rather than individual tips.

---

## Protocol (Strict — Same as Changelog Tips)

```
# Tip: {Page Title}

**Source:** {Page title} — {Section}
**Date scraped:** 2026-02-17
**URL:** https://docs.cursor.com/en/{path}
**Verification status:** VERBATIM | PARAPHRASE | NOT-FOUND-BUT-THOUGHT-OF-IT

---

## What this teaches

{Reasoning about why this is interesting or useful. Include uncertainty, hedges, qualifiers. Do not strip them.}

---

## Quote from docs (verbatim)

> "{Exact text from the page, no paraphrasing}"

[If quote would exceed 3 sentences, break into separate quote blocks with bridging text]

---

## Demo talking point

{How to demonstrate this live. Specific and actionable.}

---

## Audience note

{Who this lands with and how to frame it.}
```

---

## Ralph Loop Decomposition

Each section is a sprint loop:

```
LOOP per section:
  1. FETCH   → GET https://docs.cursor.com/en/{path}.md (raw markdown endpoint)
  2. READ    → Parse content, identify key concepts (not marketing, not nav)
  3. EXTRACT → Pull verbatim quotes per concept
  4. VERIFY  → Confirm quote exists verbatim in the fetched content
  5. WRITE   → Write tip file(s) per page
  6. CLOSE   → Mark bead done, link to output file
  7. NEXT    → Check bd ready, take next unblocked task
```

---

## Bead Hierarchy

```
cursor-onboarding-kit-71q  [EPIC] Scrape docs.cursor.com
├── cursor-onboarding-kit-1lm  [EPIC] get-started (3 docs)
│   ├── [task] installation
│   ├── [task] quickstart
│   └── [task] concepts
├── cursor-onboarding-kit-26z  [EPIC] agent core (10 docs)
│   └── ...
└── ... (28 section epics total)
```

Full section list: see specs/001-sections.md
Individual task beads: see specs/002-tasks.md

---

## Compaction Protocol

On context window compaction or session restart:

```bash
cd /Users/nateb/cursor-onboarding-kit
bd ready --json           # See what's unblocked and not in_progress
bd list --status in_progress --json  # Resume any claimed but incomplete work
bd show cursor-onboarding-kit-71q   # Recheck epic status
```

Then pick up the next ready task and continue the Ralph Loop.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 448 doc pages fetched and tip files written
- [ ] Output files in `LAB-changelog-viewer/output/docs/{section}/{slug}.md`
- [ ] All task beads closed with reason "written: output/docs/..."
- [ ] All section epics closed
- [ ] Root epic closed
- [ ] `bd sync` run to commit bead state alongside output files
