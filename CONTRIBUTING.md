# Contributing

## Ground Rules

- Send focused PRs with a clear problem statement.
- Keep changes small enough to review quickly.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.

## Licensing Model (Read First)

This repository uses mixed licensing:

- Default repository license: MIT (`LICENSE`)
- Full scope map: `LICENSES.md`
- Directory-specific overrides apply where present.

By submitting a contribution, you agree your changes are licensed under
the applicable license for the files you modify.

## DCO Sign-Off (Required)

This project uses the Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1 (`DCO`).
Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` trailer.

Use:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your message"
```

For an existing commit:

```bash
git commit --amend --signoff
```

The trailer format must match your commit identity:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

## CLA Status

No Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is required right now.

If project governance later needs explicit patent grants or centralized
relicensing rights, this may move to an Apache-style ICLA/CCLA model.
