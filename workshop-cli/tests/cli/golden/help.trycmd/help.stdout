Workshop is a cognitive architecture for AI agents operating in Cursor IDE.

It provides:
  - Taint analysis for security (protect secrets from exfiltration)
  - Cursor SQLite integration (read conversation history)
  - Knowledge management (UserMemory schema, workshop folders)
  - Processing pipeline (5 Cs: Capture, Cut, Carve, Chamfer, Check)
  - Proof of work (Showboat executable documents)

The guiding principle: "Ask me clarifying questions until you know what
I want to build and walk me through the setup step by step."
